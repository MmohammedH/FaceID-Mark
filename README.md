# FaceID-Mark
             is an innovative project designed to streamline attendance tracking by harnessing the power of OpenCV's cutting-edge facial recognition technology. This project leverages OpenCV's robust capabilities to detect and identify faces in real-time, making attendance management more efficient and convenient than ever before.

Key Features:

1)Face Detection: Our project employs OpenCV's state-of-the-art facial detection algorithms to identify and locate faces accurately within a given frame. This ensures that no attendance entry is missed.

2)Attendance Marking: Once a face is detected and recognized, our system logs the attendance entry automatically. No manual input is required, reducing the risk of errors and saving precious time.

3)Streamlit Integration: "OpenCV FaceID Mark" seamlessly integrates with a user-friendly Streamlit app. With this app, you can easily access and visualize attendance data in real-time, making it an ideal solution for teachers, businesses, or event organizers.
